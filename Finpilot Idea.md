## **5\. Actionable positioning & messaging**

4. **Built for borderless earners** – Highlight live FX wallets and creator-payout integrations (Payoneer, stable-coin). Tagline: *“Budget in USD, spend in EUR, get paid in INR – instantly reconciled.”* ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mintuit/comments/1i76vr2/am_i_the_only_one_that_needs_multicurrency/))turn6view0

7. **Community-first marketing** – Seed success stories in r/personalfinance, r/ynab, r/digitalnomad, offering 90-day trials for ex-Mint users; reflect language users already use (*“overwhelmed… need hand-holding”*). ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/rqkpei/starting_to_get_organized_but_frustrated_by/))
